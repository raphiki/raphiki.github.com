Yesterday they made their very first coming out on the new [QSOS Website](http://www.qsos.org)...

__But why monkeys? Isn't QSOS own logo all about a Tux?__

Well, starting whith Linux, a lot of open source projects use animal as a totem:

* Perl is a Camel
* PHP is an Elephant
* Squid is... a Squid
* And so on...

This was democratized by O'Reilly's coverbooks also.

So QSOS being about technological watch of many open source projects, it has no problem with being labelled as a __menagerie__.

And furthermore, monkeys here signify at least three more things:

* As a wise triad, Iwazaru, Kikazaru & Mizaru mean: _There is not evil in QSOS_!

* I feel more linked to monkeys, that must be the african part of my heritage

* I even was bitten by one when I was younger, maybe Linus had the same _Eureka!_ moment when being charged at by a penguin ;)
